/*  Three Little Pigs
 
 Since there are 3 specific options for house materials in the story, I decided to use an enum to represent those options.
 
    - Note I chose to conform my enum to the 'CaseIterable' protocol. Protocols are an advanced topic, but in this case, 'CaseIterable' lets you easily create an array of all of the cases of an enum. You can learn more about it here https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/caseiterable
 */
enum HouseMaterial: CaseIterable {
    case straw
    case sticks
    case bricks
}

/* This time around I am starting out by defining some structs that make up the characters in the story. When I was doing this the two important questions I asked myself were:
    - What attributes does the character have?
    - What behaviors does the character have?
 
 Those answers helped define the properties and methods of my structs.

 In the Pig struct, I decided to make the 'house' property an optional HouseMaterial because at the beginning of the story, the pigs do not have houses.
